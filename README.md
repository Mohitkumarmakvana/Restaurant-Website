# Restaurant-Website
The ZIP file contains a project directory titled "food zone website", which appears to be a complete front-end website for a restaurant or food-related business. Upon extracting the ZIP archive, the structure reveals a combination of HTML files and multimedia assets, indicating that this project was likely designed as a static website intended to showcase the business's offerings in an engaging and visual format.

Within the folder, one of the key components is the presence of HTML files like about us.html, which suggests the site contains dedicated sections or pages to describe the business, its background, or values. These HTML files form the backbone of the website's structure, controlling how content is displayed in a browser.

A significant portion of the contents consists of image files in various formats such as .jpeg, .jpe, and .gif. These files are likely used throughout the site for different purposes — for instance, high-quality photographs in the photo gallery sections, menu previews in menu display areas, or even decorative images for branding and style. Many of the images are named with terms like “photo gallery” or “menu,” which reinforces the visual and promotional nature of the website.

The inclusion of the .DS_Store file suggests the ZIP was originally created on a macOS system. This file is a system-generated metadata file that is not relevant to the website's operation and can be safely ignored or deleted when deploying the website on a server.

Overall, this ZIP archive represents a static website project that blends structured HTML with rich media content to create a visually appealing and informative experience. It’s likely meant for local preview in a browser or simple hosting environments and could be used by students, designers, or small business owners looking to promote a food brand or restaurant online.
