# Restaurant-Website
The ZIP file contains a folder named "food zone website", which appears to be a basic website project for a food business or restaurant. It includes HTML files like about us.html and many image files in formats such as .jpeg, .jpe, and .gif, likely used for a gallery, menus, or other visual content on the site.
